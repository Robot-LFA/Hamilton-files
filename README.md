# Overview

Included in this repo are the files required to run a Hamilton STAR for LFA optimization, as described in "Automated liquid handling robot for rapid lateral flow assay development". The specific files included are the Hamilton method file and associated liquid classes. For the liquid classes included, it is recommended to adjust the calibration curve for each liquid class in house. Elevation is known to impact liquid delivery, and therefore needs to be adjusted when implemented in a new location.
